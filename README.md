# Avern's Testbench
This repo holds the testbench portion of my site, which is directly connected to Github.
Any testing, dicking around or creation will first be done on testbench in seperate repos under subdomain 'tb.avern.dev'.
More specific projects will have their own github repo's and will be hosted on testbench with its own subdirectory ig "Elephant-Experiment" would be located at 'tb.avern.dev/elephant-experiment'.
